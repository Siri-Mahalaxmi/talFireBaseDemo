# TODO: Make Website Background More Professional

- [x] Edit src/index.css: Replace rainbow gradient with subtle blue-to-white gradient, remove animation, update card background to neutral white, adjust button/header colors to professional blue palette.
- [x] Edit src/App.css: Change .App-header background to light neutral (#f5f5f5) for consistency.
- [x] Edit src/CoverPage.css: Retain background image but add subtle gradient fallback for professional alignment.
- [x] Run `npm start` to test the app locally.
- [x] Use browser_action to launch browser, navigate to key pages, and screenshot for visual confirmation.
